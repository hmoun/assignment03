# assignment03
In this assignment you will implement a program that counts and prints the total number of ones in an array of integers. The integers in the array are randomly generated with values between 0 and 5.
Your task is to experiment with different versions of a parallel implementation of the above program. You will follow a shared memory model using Posix threads. Your first task is to write code that generates an array of random integers with values between 0 and 5 (inclusive). You are required to submit a report along with the code. In your report, you should experiment with arrays of different sizes, namely 1,000, 1,000,000, and 1,000,000,000 integers. You should also experiment with a different number of threads, namely 1, 2, 4, and 32. Your report should include tables/plots showing how the runtime of the program differs as a function of the size of the array/number of threads. Start your report with a summary of your findings. The runtime of the program should not include the time it takes to generate the array.
